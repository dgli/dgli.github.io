			<p>The keystone of Mackenzie's grade 11 physics class has always been the bridge project. Students were asked to construct a truss bridge out of popsicle sticks and lepage carpenter-glue. The bridge had very strict weight restrictions, and must span the distance of about a meter.</p>
			<h3>Key Features</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Clever use of truss structures</li>
			  <li>Demostrates through understanding of trusses</li>
			  <li>Demostrates good construction skills</li>
			  <li> </li>
	      </ul>
			<h3>Design Challenges</h3>
			<p>The bridge had to be under 190g in weight, and must span an 1 meter gap.  Due to this constraint, the materials much be used very efficiently to achieve a high performance design. We evaluated many truss bridge designes, compared their strengths and weaknesses, and settled on the lenticular pratt truss. The lenticular design allowed the center (where the load is applied) to be much stronger, and the pratt truss design allows the diagonal members to be in tension instead of compression.</p>
