			<p>During a winter hackathon hosted by UKEN GAMES, we (Dan Zapornikov and I) were teamed up to create a game in 24 hours. The game could be on PC or mobile devices. The team sat in the north-east corner of the computer lab tapping furiously on their mechanical keyboards as our minds rapidly translates out ideas and concepts into code. Fueled by boxes of pizza and cans of energy drinks, the game was completed with marvelous success.</p>
			<h3>Key Features</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Uses the Slick2D Engine</li>
			  <li>Simple and intuitive interface</li>
			  <li>exciting game play</li>
			  <li> </li>
	      </ul>
			<h3>Design Challenges</h3>
			<p>The biggest constraint of this project is the extremely short amount of time. The 24 hour time limit requires the coders to be constantly ontop of their work, and work with extreme carefulness and precaution to minimize the time that must be spent debugging unexpected errors otherwise. There are many other constraints, but these are the ones that were the most important:</p>
<ul>
	    <li>Very little time (24 hours!)</li>
	    <li>Game shouldn't be over-complicated</li>
	    <li>Should be relatiely easy to implement</li>
	    <li>Requires frequent organization and testing to prevent bugs</li>
	    </ul>
