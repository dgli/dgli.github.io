			<p>During the early stages of Praxis II, the praxis groups were given the task to find and research a specific problem that is currently troubling the citizens of the GTA. Our team took on the challenge of unauthorized entry in apartment buildings. The final result is to be presented in the style of a formal RFP (Request for Proposal).</p>
			<h3>Key Features</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Clear data through extensive research</li>
			  <li>Contacts with stakeholders for relevancy if information</li>
			  <li>Addresses a major security problem in downtown GTA</li>
			  <li> </li>
	      </ul>
			<h3>Design Challenges</h3>
			<p>This was a research intensive project, and it required a lot of contacts with stakeholders, visits to problem sites (physically not on the internet), and scrubbing through manuals to find guidelines related to the info. This RFP shows the initial problem analysis process one must go through in order to effectively solve a problem.</p>
<ul>
	    <li>The problem must be worth solving</li>
	    <li>The RFP must be presented with trustable data</li>
	    <li>The team must contact many stakeholders</li>
	    <li>The RFP must be presented in a formal format</li>
	    </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
