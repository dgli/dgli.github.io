			<p>Videogames are important parts of any North-American highschool teenager's highschool life. I find enjoyment not only in playing, but creating them as well. During the summer of grade 10 two friends and I formed a programming team, and decided to create a videogame in honor of our favourite Japanese videogame franchise, Project Touhou. This project was meant to be a tangent off of the original franchise. Our team now refers ourselves as LANEX-DOUJIN TEAM. &quot;Doujin&quot; meaning &quot;fan made work&quot;.			</p>
			<h3>Key Features:			</h3>
			<ul>
			  <li>Cross-platform</li>
			  <li>Coded in Java <em>(WHO SAID YOU CAN'T MAKE GAMES IN JAVA!?)</em></li>
			  <li>Uses LWJGL's Java-OpenGL binding libraries for high graphical performance</li>
			  <li>IT'S A GAME! :D</li>
			  <li></li>
          </ul>
			<h3>Design Challenges</h3>
			<p>As a student who does not hesitate to call himself a programmer and a designer, this project has presented me with a number of difficulties and design challenges. The project was created with the following high-level objectives in mind:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Must be efficient.</li>
			  <li>Must be well organized. </li>
			  <li>Should be easy to implement new features</li>
			  <li>Should provide a platform for future development</li>
			  <li>Should look PRETTY!</li>
		  </ul>
