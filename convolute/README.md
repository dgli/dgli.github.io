#{Convolute}
### A web-based Discrete-Time Convolution Demo.

Signals and Systems can be fun; but unless you fully understand what the 
convolution is, things can be quite frustrating!  

This is a web-app I made that demonstrates convolutions in real time.  You
are able to take any two functions and do a discrete-time convolution operation
on them.  Through this process I hope whose of you who are confused will derive
a more intuitive understanding of what it is, how it's values are derived,
and hopefully just how interesting it can be. :P

--------------------------

##### Currently the program supports:
- convoluting predefined functions.
- edit existing functions and save changes.
- easily usable graph space (zoom in, zoom out, move around, etc)
- You can currently only make one new function due to incomplete implementation of function naming parameters. 


##### Next steps on my todo list for this app:
- animate convolution process.
- convolution algorithm optimization: The current function used to convolute two functions is slow because it was meant to be a quick hand-waving solution with computational complexity of O(n^2).  It can easily be changed to a O(n) algorithm by taking into account the finite differences between each step of increase in N.  

- make multiple (more than one) custom functions work.
- add a button to save the result of a convolution as a new function.
- error checking. (right now the editor assumes the user will not try to mess it up)


##### Others?:
- multiple browser support.
- other things I canâ€™t get off the top of my head.

### Credits and Thanks:

This web-app's HTML framework is based on Evan Wallace's Web-GL Filters app.
I did not think one would be capable of achieving such elegance in  web-apps
before stumbling upon the works of Evan Wallace.  He is an inspiration.

The editor I used is the ACE editor. You can find them here: http://ace.c9.io/

The graphing utilies I used is by Dygraph: http://dygraphs.com/
